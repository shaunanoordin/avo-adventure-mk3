## Routine

A Routine is a catch-all term for an in-game event or in-game script.

For example, if the player reaches the exit of a dungeon, we can start the
"VictoryCountdownRoutine" to transition the game from a playable state to the
"Congratulations, you won!" screen, over 5 seconds, with some visual flourish.

- `Routine.js` provides the base code for all Routine types.
